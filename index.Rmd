# Description

This is a collection of my personal notes on the Reticular Action Model (RAM) notation
that accompanies the `ram` package. 
You can install the released version of `ram` from [GitHub](https://github.com/jeksterslab/ram) with:

```r
remotes::install_github("jeksterslab/ram")
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'ram'
), 'packages.bib')
```

These notes are based on the following resources:

- @Boker-2005
- @McArdle-1984
- @McArdle-2005

See [GitHub Pages](https://jeksterslab.github.io/ram_notes/index.html)
for the html deployment.
