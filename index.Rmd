# Description

This is a collection of my notes
on the Reticular Action Model (RAM) notation
that accompanies the `ramR` package [@R-ramR]
in the `R` statistical environment [@R-base].
You can install the released version of `ramR`
from [GitHub](https://github.com/jeksterslab/ramR) with:

```r
remotes::install_github("jeksterslab/ramR")
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(
  c(
    .packages(),
    "ramR",
    "stats",
    "lavaan",
    "OpenMx"
  ),
  "packages.bib"
)
```

These notes are based on the following resources:

- @Boker-2005
- @McArdle-1984
- @McArdle-2005
